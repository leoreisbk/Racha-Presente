EDStarRating
---------------

A configurable star rating control for OSX and iOS, similar to those found in iTunes and the App Store.


###Installation

The easiest way to install EDStarRating is via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Add this line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'EDStarRating'
```

and run `pod install`. 

You can also install it manually by copying to project these two files: EDStarRating.h and EDStarRating.m

### Usage

 In order to use EDStarRating, you can instantiate it programmatically, or create a custom view in Interface Builder and assign it to an ivar of your app. Once you have an instance, you can use the control properties to configure it.

Example:

```

  starRating.starImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"star.png"];
  starRating.starHighlightedImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"starhighlighted.png"];
  starRating.maxRating = 5.0;
  starRating.delegate = self;
  starRating.horizontalMargin = 12;
  starRating.editable=YES;
  displayMode=EDStarRatingDisplayFull;


  starRating.rating= 2.5;

```
### Compatiblity
This control should work in ARC and not ARC projects. On OS X 10.6+ and iOS 4.x+.
But i've only tested it with ARC and Lion 10.7 and iOS 5.0. Let me now if it works fine for you in other environments.
