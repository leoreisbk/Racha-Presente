/**
 BCScannerViewController is a view controller that wrapps the scanning
 capabilities of iOS7 into a simple to use drop-in view controller for easy
 integration into your app.
 
 It is build for the purpose of scanning a single or multiple codes in a
 deticated screen and encapsules all the camera handling and metadata gathering.
 
 The view controller can be presented or pushed onto a navigation stack. It is
 up to you to present and dismiss the view controller whenever you need it.
