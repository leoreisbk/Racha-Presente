`BCScanner` is a barcode and qr code scanner library that makes use of the built in `AVFoundation` code scanning capabilities. It lets you easily integrate a barcode or qr code scanner into your application without dealing with `AVFoundation`.


## Requirements

`BCScanner` is bild for the use with iOS7+. If you still do support iOS6, make sure to check the `+[BCScanner scannerAvailable]` method before making any other calls to `BCScanner`. `BCScanner` is not compatible with iOS6 because of the internal use of new `AVFoundation` API.
`BCScanner` also requires you to use ARC.


## Dependencies

- UIKit
- AVFoundation
- QuartzCore


## Install

### cocoapods

The easiest way to install this module is to add the library through cocoapods:

    pod 'BCScanner'

If you want to specify a certain version of `BCScanner` please note that this project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). This means it is save to upgrade to every minor and patch release as this is fully backwards compatible. If you want to provide a version in your podfile, use this line:

    pod 'BCScanner', '~> 0.1'


### static library

If you, for some reason, do not want to directly integrate the project from the git repository, there is a [binary release in the release section on github](https://github.com/michaelochs/BCScanner/releases) for every version. This bundle includes a pre compiled library as well as a local `podspecs` file you can use to integrate the library locally.


### other integration

Currently, other types of integrations are not supported officially, however they are possible by simply using the library or the repository and adding `AVFoundation` as a dependency. Please also remember to add the `-ObjC` flag to your 'other linker flags' build settings.

See `BCScannerExample` target for a reference, if you have problems, linking the library.


## Example

To build the example project run `pod install` inside the `Example` folder and open up the `BCScanner.xcworkspace` file. Make sure you are using the workspace and not the project itself if you are experiencing issues.
