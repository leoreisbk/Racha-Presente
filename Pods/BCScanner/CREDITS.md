The project was initially developed in 2013/2014 to provide a convenient, ready to use drop in view controller for scanning various code types. It wraps all `AVFoundation` functionality so that you do not need to deal with it in your code.

The project is available under the Apache 2 license. Please see the `LICENSE` file for more information.
